                <p>
                    We are a non profit  based organization named The Littlest Lamb founded in 2007 by Mira Riad. We finished
                    building a state of the art facility for orphaned and at-risk children in 2014, located near the outskirts of Cairo,
                    Egypt. We opened our doors with one child in 2015, fast forward to 2022 with 90 children and a full dedicated team and
                    community to raising the standard of care for orphaned children.
                    
                    During the waiting period of design, program building and construction phases we worked hard on fundraising to secure
                    and grow an endowment fund to continue to serve orphaned and vulnerable children country wide.
                    
                    Our first project, Birdrock Home, is an exceptional home for orphaned, vulnerable and at-risk children (OVC). Some of
                    our children have one living parent or relative that consider Birdrock Home as a last resort to save their child and
                    family. Other times, they are completely abandoned with no ties to any biological family. We offer these children the
                    chance to become game changers in society and to break the stigma of being an orphan in Egypt. We have invested in our
                    90 children by providing them with personalized, curated programs and schedules, trauma-informed staff, and a beautiful
                    facility on a 9 acre plot with sports and arts amenities. This provides an incredible wave of pride for them. Our home
                    is designed to hold 13 smaller families in their apartments with 2-3 caregivers who take shifts throughout the week. We
                    are investing in these children to give them the the quality of life and top education to become future CHANGE MAKERS
                    who will transform Egyptian society.

                    the street both on abandoned to cater for themselves, about a million new babies are abadoned in the hospitals. We
                    love and care for as much as we can with the help of GOD and generous persons who support the foundation.</p>
